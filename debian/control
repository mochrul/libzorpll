Description: Low level library functions for Zorp
 Zorp is a new generation firewall. It is essentially a transparent proxy
 firewall, with strict protocol analyzing proxies, a modular architecture,
 and fine-grained control over the mediated traffic. Configuration decisions
 are scriptable with the Python based configuration language.
 .
 This package contains low level library functions needed by Zorp and
 associated programs.
